The edger can also be used for smaller trenching jobs such as electric fence installation or creating an underground cable run to a garage or shed.","MUTI-ANGLE CUTTING: Our multi-position pivoting head offers 5 different cutting angles from 70-110 degrees allowing the user to select the angle that is best suited to handle any type of grass they need to edge. Head adjustment is made by simply sliding the single-hand operated lever into the appropriate notch on the adjustment plate.","PRECISION LINES: Clean professional lines can be easily achieved regardless of grass type when you combine the balance of a 4-wheeled design with multi-angled cutting. Use the 90-degree angle option to slice through standard blade grass or select between angles of 70, 80, 100, and 110 degrees to create a clean edge when dealing with creeping or tuberous grasses.","FLEXIBLE DEPTH CONTROL: Take complete control over your depth of cut with our flexible control mechanism. From the operating position, engage the adjustment lever with one-hand to select from over 5 different depth settings from 0.5 inches up to 3.5 inches.","DEBRIS GUARD AND TOOL HOLDER: A durable chain skirting protects the operator from flying debris while the attached tool holder provides a convenient place to store smaller hand tools making them easily available for lawn and sidewalk detailing.","WARRANTY AND SERVICE: Earthquake is committed to providing a great product and an even better user experience which is why the Edger is backed by a 5-Year limited warranty and US-based service and support."]},{"title":"SOUTHLAND SWLE0799 79cc Walk Behind Gas Lawn Edger","images":{"Small":{"URL":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41pG56Dg-9L._SL75_.jpg","Height":75,"Width":75},"Medium":{"URL":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41pG56Dg-9L._SL160_.jpg","Height":160,"Width":160},"Large":{"URL":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41pG56Dg-9L._SL500_.jpg","Height":500,"Width":500}},"contents":["Metal frame and blade guard for increased durability","Product dimensions – 30.31” L x 19.29” W x 18.5” H | Weight – 60 lbs. | RPM – 3600 RPM | Engine – 4 Stroke OHV / 79cc | Blade Size – 9-Inch, 3 point | Cut depths – 0-2.5 inches | Start type – Easy Pull recoil system","Adjustable to 5 depth positions up to 2 ½-inch deep","Fuel the stabilizer if the edger is kept unused for 30 dayS","Blade angle adjusts +/- 15 degrees for bevel edging capabilities"]},{"title":"Greenworks Pro 80V 8 inch Brushless Edger, Battery Not Included ED80L00","images":{"Small":{"URL":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31pmtMafDcS._SL75_.jpg","Height":75,"Width":75},"Medium":{"URL":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31pmtMafDcS._SL160_.jpg","Height":160,"Width":160},"Large":{"URL":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31pmtMafDcS._SL500_.jpg","Height":500,"Width":500}},"contents":["80V Lithium Ion battery delivers fade-free power with no memory loss after charging","8-In blade curb wheel s the perfect edging every time","Adjustable auxiliary handle for added user comfort and control","Cushioned overmold grip for superior comfort and control","4 year tool protects your investment","Power Source Type: Battery Powered"]},{"title":"CRAFTSMAN Edger, 3-Blade Settings, 12-Amp (CMEED400)","images":{"Small":{"URL":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/415CD1XH2yL._SL75_.jpg","Height":75,"Width":75},"Medium":{"URL":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/415CD1XH2yL._SL160_.jpg","Height":160,"Width":160},"Large":{"URL":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/415CD1XH2yL._SL500_.jpg","Height":500,"Width":500}},"contents":["POWERFUL MOTOR: 12 Amp high torque motor of the edger trimmer cuts through tough turf","COMFORT & CONTROL: Adjustable auxiliary handle of the edge trimmer provides comfort and control","PRECISION CUTTING: Line cutting guide provides precision and control while edging along hard surfaces or trenching around borders","DETAILED EDGING: 3 blade-depth settings allows you to control the cut for detailed edging","VERSATRACK hook for convenient storage with VERSARACK system"]},{"title":"DEWALT DCED472B Edger, Yellow/Black","images":{"Small":{"URL":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31MFz8QYh1L._SL75_.jpg","Height":51,"Width":75},"Medium":{"URL":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31MFz8QYh1L._SL160_.jpg","Height":110,"Width":160},"Large":{"URL":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31MFz8QYh1L._SL500_.jpg","Height":345,"Width":500}},"contents":["HIGH VERSATILITY AND PRODUCTIVITY: DEWALT Universal Attachment capability to accept additional tool pieces","DURABILITY AND EFFICIENCY with 7-1/2 in. hardened steel blade and up to 2-1/2 in. adjustable blade depth","EASE OF MOVEMENT with large guide wheel for mobility while edging","SPEED CONTROL FOR OPTIMIZED POWER AND RUNTIME with variable trigger and hi/lo settings"]},{"title":"EGO Power+ EA0800 8-Inch Edger Attachment for EGO 56-Volt Lithium-ion Multi Head System","images":{"Small":{"URL":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31Pvqt113lS._SL75_.jpg","Height":70,"Width":75},"Medium":{"URL":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31Pvqt113lS._SL160_.jpg","Height":150,"Width":160},"Large":{"URL":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31Pvqt113lS._SL500_.jpg","Height":470,"Width":500}},"contents":["Exclusively compatible with EGO Power plus Power Head PH1400 (available Separately)","8 in.
