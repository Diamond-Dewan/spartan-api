No other display offers this adaptive ability to prevent your pupil from constricting in low-light causing you to no longer be able to see your target.","STEALTH ID: Electro-Optics industrial design inspired by our legendary models; deflection armor trapezoidal surfacing breaks up the shape and visibility of the optic along with pistol slide serrations and grip checkering to add function to the form of all SIG SAUER electro-optics."]}]},"body":null,"slug":"laser-rangefinder","batch":{"id":2,"keywords":"lace front wig,\nlaminator,\nlandline phone,\nlap desk,\nlaptop backpack,\nlaptop cooling pad,\nlaptop,\nlaser printer,\nlaser rangefinder,\nlaser sight,\nlatex mattresse,\nlawn edger,\nlawn fertilizer,\nlawn sprinkler,\nlawn sweeper,\nmagnetic tape,\nmagnifying glasse,\nmandoline slicer,\nmandolin slicer,\nmanual food chopper,\nmargarita machine,\nmassage cushion,\nmassage oil,\nmassage table,\nmasticating juicer,\nmattresse,\nmattress pad,\ncomputer monitors,\nPortable HDD,\nlabel maker","category":null,"created_at":"2022-03-15T17:23:45.322Z","updated_at":"2022-03-15T17:23:45.322Z"},"published_at":"2022-03-15T17:27:18.550Z","created_at":"2022-03-15T17:27:18.552Z","updated_at":"2022-03-15T17:27:18.587Z","SEO":null,"categories":[{"id":6,"name":"Sports","description":null,"department":6,"slug":"sports","published_at":"2022-03-15T17:27:18.478Z","created_at":"2022-03-15T17:27:18.481Z","updated_at":"2022-03-15T17:27:18.517Z"}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
